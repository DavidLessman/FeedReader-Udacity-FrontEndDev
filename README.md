# Overview

This is a project for the Udacity Front End Developer course to show competency with Jasmine's testing syntax.

## Instructions

Simply load the index.html file in your browser. The unit testing portion is at the bottom of the webpage.

## What did I do?

As instructed for the assignment, I only edited the feedreader.js file and created this README.md

I created most of the tests in that file. I did use online resources as reference for portions of my code. Mostly the Udacity student Q&A section and the Jasmine documentation.
